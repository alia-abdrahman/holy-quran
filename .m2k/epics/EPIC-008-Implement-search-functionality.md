# EPIC-008: Implement search functionality

## Scope
Allow users to quickly find surahs by searching. This improves navigation for users who want to jump directly to a specific surah without scrolling through all 114 surahs.

## Tickets

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| T-002 | User can search surah by typing the name of surah | done |
| T-004 | CR: Allow less rigid search behavior (phonetic matching) | done |
