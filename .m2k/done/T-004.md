# T-004: CR: Allow less rigid search behavior

**Epic:** EPIC-008
**Status:** Done

## Description
- The User should be able to find surah that are phonetically same even if the spelling is different.
- For example: When user search "fatiha", user should be able to see Al-Faatiha

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Search "fatiha" finds "Al-Faatiha"
- [x] Search "baqara" finds "Al-Baqarah"
- [x] Search handles double vowels (aa, ee, ii, oo, uu)
- [x] Search ignores "Al-" prefix
- [x] Search handles common transliteration variations (dh/d, th/t, kh/k, gh/g, sh/s)

## Technical Notes
- Implemented `_normalizeForSearch()` function in `lib/pages/home_page.dart`
- Normalizes both query and surah names before comparison
- Handles Arabic transliteration variations common in Quran surah names
- Preserves exact match for numbers and Arabic script

## Dependencies
- T-002 (basic search functionality)

## Testing
- Search "fatiha" → shows Al-Faatiha
- Search "baqara" → shows Al-Baqarah
- Search "yasin" → shows Yaseen
- Search "rahman" → shows Ar-Rahmaan
- Search "nisa" → shows An-Nisaa
- Search "shura" → shows Ash-Shura (also works with "sura")
